This project is an Arduino Music Player. It takes a file with a list of notes that can be composed into any form of music. Using the joystick and LCD Screen the user can navigate between three different songs. Once they have a song that they'd like to play, they select it, and then press "play" to play the song. The screen will change to another screen that displays the song and options: "pause" and "play." The user can choose between these options or wait until the song is over and the screen will take you back to the homescreen.

Components:
- Arduino UNO
- LCD Display
- Breadboard
- Joystick
- speaker
- wires

The code uses mutliple state machines to keep track of everything going on with the Music Player.
